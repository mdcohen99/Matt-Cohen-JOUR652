Questions

1.  In the sentence below, put in the necessary code that would allow users to click on the word Google and open Google's homepage in a new browser:

<p> <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> is the best search engine in the world.</p>




2.  Describe the purpose of a DIV tag.

A <div> tag is essentially a container that makes it easy to style and organize a page. We can use the div tag to set classes and IDs for elements of our html so that we can apply styles to them. For example, if I wrote <div id="midterm">text</div> I could apply styles to anything inside the div tags with that ID. The same would be true if I didn't include an ID or class, but the IDs and classes allow us to be more specific inside of a div tag or larger element if need be. It provides structure and layout to our page. 


3.  Write out the basic structure of an HTML page, putting the basic tags in the correct position.  (Note: you don't need to connect it to a stylesheet or include DIV tags or anything like that).

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>text</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        text text text text text
    </body>
</html>


4.  There are two main "areas" or "sections" in the basic structure of an HTML page. In which area would you put a link to a stylesheet?

Inside the <head>

5.  In which main "area" or "section" of an HTML page would you put text, images or DIV tags?

6.  In the space below, put one DIV tag with a class of graphicbox and a second DIV tag with an ID of name.

}

9.  What tag would we use to include an image on an HTML page? Just give me the name of the tag, you don't have to write out all the code.

<img src="path to wherever the photo is saved">


10.  Why do we use media queries?

Media queries are vital for the concept of responsive design. This means design that is not rigid to just one format and can adapt to different screen and browser sizes. For example, a layout that looks good on a laptop may not work on a phone and vice versa. By using media queries, we can style our webpage to make adjustments when the width of the browser is at various sizes, including laptop, tablet or phone screen widths. That creates a much better experience for the user/reader looking at our webpage. 


11. What is the main difference between a serif and a sans-serif font?

A serif font is more decorative. It has tails and feet on certain characters. It is generally seen as more formal. Sans-serif does not have the tails or feet on certain letters. It is sleeker and much more widely used on the internet. 

12. Which of the following is a hexadecimal code?
